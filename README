# INTRO

1. `Kotlin`: Call method `createMyData` which is native method.
2. `C`: will execute function `_*x_createMyData` and call method `setAddressPtr` to set field `address`.
3. `Kotlin`: Call method `doubleGrade` which is native method and pass value `address` to it.
4.  `C`: Will execute function `_*x_doubleGrade`, get the address and cast it to pointer `MyData *`. After that multiply `grade` of pointer by 2.
